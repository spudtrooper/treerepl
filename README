Provides a way to create command line itnerfaces for web services with
inherent tree-like structure.  There are two examples:

 - githubrepl
 - rdiorepl

They both require some other libraries.  The basic idea is this:
 
 1. Define the tree model for your service
 2. Define the mapping from tree to service
 3. See the example and go from there
